# 🚄 Railway Deployment Troubleshooting Guide

## 🚨 Common Railway Deployment Errors & Solutions

### ❌ Error 1: "Application failed to respond"
**Cause:** Missing PORT environment variable or wrong port binding

**Solution:**
1. In Railway dashboard → Variables tab, add:
   ```
   PORT=8080
   SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_here
   FLASK_ENV=production
   ```

2. Verify your Dockerfile has:
   ```dockerfile
   ENV PORT=8080
   CMD exec gunicorn wsgi:app --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT
   ```

### ❌ Error 2: "Build failed - requirements.txt not found"
**Cause:** Railway can't find requirements.txt in the root

**Solution:** Your requirements.txt should be in the root directory (which it is!)

### ❌ Error 3: "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'app'"
**Cause:** WSGI can't find the Flask app

**Solution:** Your wsgi.py file is correct, but ensure the path is right

### ❌ Error 4: "Database connection failed"
**Cause:** Missing database configuration

**Solution:** In Railway Variables, add:
```
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///instance/safestep.db
```

### ❌ Error 5: "Build timeout"
**Cause:** Dependencies taking too long to install

**Solution:** Optimize your requirements.txt or use Railway's faster builds

## 🔧 Step-by-Step Railway Deployment Fix

### 1. **Verify Environment Variables**
In Railway dashboard → Your Project → Variables tab, set:
```
PORT=8080
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_here_make_it_long_and_random
FLASK_ENV=production
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///instance/safestep.db
```

### 2. **Check Your Repository Structure**
Ensure these files are in your root directory:
```
webtest/
├── Dockerfile ✅
├── requirements.txt ✅
├── railway.json ✅
└── SafeStep/
    ├── app.py ✅
    ├── wsgi.py ✅
    └── ...
```

### 3. **Test Locally First**
```bash
# Test your Docker build locally
docker build -t safestep-test .
docker run -p 8080:8080 -e PORT=8080 safestep-test

# Should work at http://localhost:8080
```

### 4. **Push Changes and Redeploy**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix Railway deployment"
git push origin main
```

Railway will auto-deploy on push.

## 🐛 Debug Commands

### Check Railway Logs:
1. Go to Railway dashboard
2. Click your project
3. Click "Deployments" tab
4. Click latest deployment
5. View "Build Logs" and "Deploy Logs"

### Common Log Messages:
- ✅ `Database tables created successfully` = Good!
- ✅ `SafeStep Application Ready for Production` = Working!
- ❌ `ModuleNotFoundError` = Path issue
- ❌ `Port already in use` = Port conflict
- ❌ `Failed to bind to 0.0.0.0:$PORT` = Port variable missing

## 🔄 Alternative Quick Fix

If Railway still fails, try **Render.com** instead:

1. Go to [render.com](https://render.com)
2. New → Web Service
3. Connect your GitHub repo
4. Use these settings:
   - **Runtime:** Docker
   - **Build Command:** (leave empty)
   - **Start Command:** (leave empty)

Your `SafeStep/render.yaml` file will handle the rest automatically!
